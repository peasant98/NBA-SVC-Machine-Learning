# NBA-SVC-Machine-Learning
My progression from learning Numpy to implementing Support Vector Classification to predict someone's expected position in the NBA based on their height and weight.

For example, if the user inputs a height of 7 feet, 1 inches and a weight of 270 pounds, they will be predicted to be the size of an NBA center.

I used the data.nba.net API to find the information of every NBA player this year, and use that to predict, given a height and weight, what position that size is closest to.
